There are 1 region(s) with p-value less than 1e-5. Please 
note that these results are inflated due to the overfitting 
inherent in finding the best-fit PRS (but it's still best 
to find the best-fit PRS!). 
You can use the --perm option (see manual) to calculate an 
empirical P-value.

There are 1 region(s) with p-value less than 1e-5. Please 
note that these results are inflated due to the overfitting 
inherent in finding the best-fit PRS (but it's still best 
to find the best-fit PRS!). 
You can use the --perm option (see manual) to calculate an 
empirical P-value.

There are 1 region(s) with p-value less than 1e-5. Please 
note that these results are inflated due to the overfitting 
inherent in finding the best-fit PRS (but it's still best 
to find the best-fit PRS!). 
You can use the --perm option (see manual) to calculate an 
empirical P-value.
